A regular node has a capacity, which is equivalent to biomass
Superpeers are the hyphae

Hyphae are either:
 * Immobile (are connected to enough superpeers)
 * Branching (are not connected to enough superpeers)
 * Extending (have not concentrated enough biomass)

If an hypha is undercapacity:
 * Immobile hyphae send signals along each connected hypha requesting
  biomass
 * Two adjacent undercapacity hyphae will attempt to merge if their
  capacities allow
 * Branching hyphae will attempt to acquire new superpeers
 * Extending hyphae will attempt to acquire new biomass nodes
If a hypha is overcapacity:
 * If it is a branching hypha it will 

Nodes have a capacity; capacity
The biomass of a non-hyphal node is its capacity
The biomass of a hyphal node is its own capacity plus the capacity of
its connected non-hyphal nodes 

WHAT THINGS ARE:
Nodes are either biomass ("potential hypha") an actual hypha

Hypha are either immobile, branching, or extending
Extending hyphae discover and absorb new biomass
Branching hyphae grow new hypha and absorb biomass from extending hyphae
Immobile hyphae concentrate biomass from branches

RULES

BIOMASS RULES

If an immobile hypha does not have enough biomass:
 * absorb biomass from a connected branching or extending hypha

If a branching hypha does not have enough biomass:
 * absorb biomass from an extending hypha

If a biomass node is unattached, associated with a random extending hypha

HYPHAL RULES

Immobile hypha must maintain sufficient hypha.  They have two separate
hyphal capacities: connected immobile hyphae and connected branching
hyphae

If an immobile hypha does not have enough connected immobile hypha:
 * grow a connection to another known immobile hypha (this helps ensure
   the continguity of the network

If an immobile hypha does not have enough connected branching hypha::
 * if a branch is sufficiently undercapacity, absorb that branch
 * if no branches are undercapacity, become a branching hypha

If an immobile hypha has too many connected hyphae:
 * For each extra hypha, pass it to a branch

If a branching hypha is undercapacity and has no extending nodes:
 * become an extending hypha

If a branching hypha does not have enough connected extending hypha:
 * "grow" a new hypha in one of its connected biomass nodes

If a branching hypha has too many connected extending hypha:
 * Become an immobile hypha, promote the highest-capacity extending
   hypha to a branching hypha, and pass excess extending hypha to the
   new branching hypha

If an extending hypha is at capacity:
 * Become a branching hypha

HEALING AND RECOVERY RULES

If a hypha loses its connection with a neighboring hypha (hyphal
connection is dead):
 * self-heal by connecting to another hypha
 * the lowest-ranked hypha does the connecting (i.e., if an extending
 hypha loses its connection to a branching hypha.

If there are insufficient hyphae below some overall threshhold,
"spore" by generating new random extending hyphae.

If a hypha is disconnected, connect to a random hypha
