* Preliminaries

- All needed libraries (including PeerSim) should already be in the
  =lib/= directory.  The primary prerequisite is for Apache Ant, which
  is used for the build scripts. A relatively recent version of Java
  is also needed.

- To compile, simply run =ant compile= from the root. The unchecked
  conversion warnings from PeerSim can be safely ignored.

* Running a Simulation

- A convenience script is used to launch the simulation. This script,
  =run=, is a Bourne shell script, and will only work on UNIX-like
  systems.  If you are using Myconet on Windows, you will need to
  create an equivalent =run.bat= or =run.cmd= file by using this file
  as a guide for how to set the Java classpath.

- The configuration for an individual experiment is performed using a
  text file. All of the relevant parameters can be found in the
  =example-*.txt= files in the root of the repository..

Not all parameters are discussed; only those that you are most likely
to be interested in changing are discussed.

| *Basic Parameters*                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------+
| =config.basename=                                              |
| A string to be used as the basis for output file names         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------+
| =network.size=                                                 |
| The number of peers/nodes in the simluation                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------+
| =simulation.cycles=                                            |
| The number of rounds to execute the simulation                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------+
| =random.seed=                                                  |
| If uncommented, a particular random scenario can be reproduced |


| *Myconet Parameters*                                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| =init.pow.max=                                                               |
| Nodes are assigned capacities via a power-law distribution;                  |
| this is the cutoff that determines the largest node in the system.           |
| It should be selected based on the simulation size.  A value that is         |
| too high will result in a degenerate network with all nodes connected        |
| to a single superpeer; too small, and the network will be sprawling and      |
| inefficient. Consult the Myconet papers for suitable value for different     |
| network sizes.                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| =protocol.fng.strategy_map=                                                  |
| The maps possible protocol states that a node can be in to a Strategy        |
| class that specifies the behavior to be followed.  For ordinary Myconet this |
| should be set to =fungus.BasicMyconetStrategyMap=, and for SODAP it should   |
| be set to =fungus.SemiBulwarkStrategyMap=.                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You likely will not need to modify the core Myconet protocols, though
if you are working on a SODAP-related project you will need to
familiarize yourself with that part of the codebase.

| Protocols                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.dat fungus.HyphaData=                                                   |
| A passive protocol serving as data storage. If you want to set a value for        |
| every node, this is the easiest place to store it. NOTE WELL: you cannot just     |
| set per-node values in a constructor, due to PeerSim's extensive use of           |
| clone()! To set a per-node value at the start of the simulation, you must         |
| use an initializer (see the classes associated with =init.*= entries).            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.lnk fungus.HyphaLink=                                                   |
| Stores the graph that defines the neighbor relationships, and provides            |
| methods to change those relationships.                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.fng fungus.FungalGrowth=                                                |
| Consults the strategy map to determine what actions should be taken by a node,    |
| given its current state.  Myconet protocol rules are implemented in each          |
| strategy.                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.myc fungus.MycoCast=                                                    |
| Used by nodes to find new candidate neighbors                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.fail fungus.FailureAlerter=                                             |
| Only used by HITAP, but needed by all scenarios because it's not properly         |
| isolated from the rest of the codebase yet.   Be sure that =inhibition_strategy_=  |
| and =bulwark_strategy= are both set to the appropriate null strategy.             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =protocol.chem fungus.ChemicalManager=                                            |
| As with the failure alerter, only relevant to HITAP scenarios, but does need      |
| to be enabled.                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


Comment or uncomment a particular control to enable/disable it.  The
parameters for a control do not need to be commented out to disable
it, as they will not be read if the control is not enabled.

| Controls                                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.dnet* fungus.Nodulator=                                                       |
| Use the Nodulator to define dynamics (attacks and churn).                              |
| For complex scenarios, you may have to write your own control.  If =add= is between    |
| -1 and 1, the number will be interpreted as a percentage of nodes (of the specified    |
| type) that should be killed.  If outside this range, will be intepreted as a fixed     |
| number of nodes.  =from= and =to= specify which rounds the Nodulator will operate,     |
| and =period= can be used to run every $n$-th cycle. The =type= can be set to select    |
| from different subsets of nodes: =all=, =hypha=, =immobile=, =branching=, =extending=, |
| =biomass=,  =largest=.                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.lo fungus.LogObserver=                                                        |
| Controls logging and log levels. Consult the config file for examples                  |
| of how to use these settings.  To just focus on particular classes,                    |
| add =control.lo.classes.YourClass= lines.                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.jv fungus.JungVisualizer=                                                     |
| Enables a GUI for visualizations. This does not work well with many more               |
| than a few hundred nodes, and will need to be disabled for larger simulations.         |
| Also, note the the layout algorithm does not do a very good job of displaying          |
| SODAP networks once the biomass peers have begun to raise their parent targets.        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.jv fungus.VisualizerTransformers=                                             |
| If you wish to tweak how the visualizer behaves, the easiest way is probably           |
| by subclassing VisualizerTransformers.  The visualizer is written using JUNG,          |
| a Java graph library. Consult the JUNG docs for more details                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.pcv fungus.PeerRatioChartFrame=                                               |
| An example of how to get live charts out of a simulation; this will need to            |
| be tweaked to your particular scenario.                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =control.disconnect fungus.DisconnectControl=                                          |
| This is the control that makes SODAP work! If =control.disconnect.parent_strategy=     |
| is set to =fungus.NullParentStrategy=, then the simulation will behave as a            |
| normal Myconet scenario. If it is set to =fungus.TotalFailureParentStrategy=, then     |
| parent targets will be adjusted as per SODAP rules.                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Order of execution is a significant consideration.  The order of
controls is specified by =order.control=, and the order of protocols
by =order.protocols=.  This is described in the PeerSim docs, and
should be read carefully, as your simulation will be very difficult
to understand and debug if you do not keep this information in mind.

- Controls are run *alphabetically*, unless =order.control= is
  specified.  In that case, the specified, enabled controls run in
  that order, followed by all enabled controls that were not
  listed (in alphabetical order).

- Protocols follow similar rules.  Specified, then alphabetical.

Recall, however, that controls run for the entire network, while
protocols execute per node.  In some cases, we want some controls to
run, then let the protocols execute, then run the remaining controls.
For that, the =control.protocols= line in the table above is used,
which lets us specify =protocols= in the controls list.  It is
possible to intersperse controls and protocols further, but that gets
more complex and you are unlikely to need it for this project.

This can be seen in the following line:

=order.control shf dnet dnet2 disconnect protocols jg degree jv=

In this case the =Shuffle= control is run first (to make sure that nodes
are processed in a different order every cycle. Then the =dnet=
Nodulators run, to kill nodes and add new ones.  Following that the
SODAP =disconnect= control adjusts parent targets.  (This should more
properly be implemented as a protocol, but was done as a control for
speed, due to a looming deadline.)  Then, all of the Myconet
protocols are executed for the nodes.  =jg= is the
=JungGraphObserver= control, that creates an easy-to-manipulate graph
data structure that can be used by other observers (so it is very
important that it be run /after/ all action is complete, but /before/
the other observers that need it.  =degree= calculates some graph
statistics based on the JUNG graph, and =jv= is the visualizer, which
is updated only after everything else is complete.

Annoyingly, a disabled control has to be removed from the order list,
or it will result in an error.  If you create a new control, remember
that is will be run at the very end, unless you specify otherwise!
This is probably not what you want.

* Visualizer

Once you run the simulation with the visualizer enabled, you will see
a number of buttons.  Note that the position of the nodes on the
screen does not represent their actual location...it is a layout
algorith that attempts to make the neighbor relationships clear, which
is the significant aspect.  With the basic =VisualizerTransformers=
enabled, small blue circles are biomass, red triangles are extending
hyphae, yellow squares are branching hyphae, and green pentagons are
immobile hyphae.

The JUNG layout code has a couple of bugs in it, which results in an
occasional race condition and null pointer exception (halting the
layout update algorithm).  Should this occur, just kill the simulation
and restart.

- =freeze= pauses the layout algorithm, which can be useful when you
  are letting the simulation run for a number of rounds and don't
  care about what's happening in between.  Clicking the button again
  restarts the layout engine.
- =capture= takes a picture of the displayed graph and saves it to
  the =capture/= directory using the basename specified in the config
  file.
- =pause= stops a running or walking simulation.
- =step= advances the simulation by one cycle
- =walk= starts the simulation advancing with a short delay between
  each cycle. If this delay is too short, you'll need to change it
  in the code.
- =run= starts the simulation running without pausing between cycles.
  If you click =run= (say, because you want to get to round 80, fast),
  it's best to freeze the layout to reduce the chance of the null
  pointer error.
